# DKCryptoAlgorithm
This is Deepak Kumar's Cryptographic Algorithm
This is a Cryptographic Algorithm, which is very simple to implement. Still, It will be able to handle cryprographic attacks from huge computational capacity devices like Quantum Computers. It is a symmetric Key Algorithm. It is quite safe that, initial Nonce can be used to create Symmetric Keys from a Public Key.
